# logs
Please note that this logger is functioning but NOT done. 
I am planning on finishing it later. I still need to write tests and add documentation.
If you want to use this logger that is totally fine but keep in mind that no documentation is available.
To understand how this logger works, you can check the `examples` folder and check the source file.
